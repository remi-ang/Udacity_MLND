\section{Definition}

\subsection{Project Overview}

Object recognition is a major discipline in the field of computer vision and finds countless applications in domains asvaried as self-driving vehicles (i.e. vehicle environment detection), medicine (i.e. skin cancer diagnosis) or turism (i.e. points of interests recognition).

This project focus on the recognition of flower species with the objective to demonstrate the possibility to identify a flower variety based on a simple picture. Possible application of automatic flower recognition could be:

\begin{itemize}
	\item population acking and preservation (imagine drones taking a census of flowers in your neighbourhood)
	\item crop and food supply managment 
	\item toxicity detection ()
	\item Education (i.e. smartphone app for hitch-hiker and nature lovers)
	\item ...
	
\end{itemize}
