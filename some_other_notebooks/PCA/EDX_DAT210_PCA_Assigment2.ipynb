    "In Lab Assignment 1, you applied PCA to a dataset generated by 3D-scanning an actual sculpture. Real life 3D objects are a good segue to PCA, since it's fun to see its effects on a dataset we can see and touch. Another benefit is that all three spatial dimensions, x, y, and z, each measure the same unit-length relative to one another, so no extra consideration need be made to account for PCA's weakness of requiring feature scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now the fun is over. Gaining some practical experience with real-world datasets, which rarely allot you the luxury of having features all on the same scale, will help you see how critical feature scaling is to PCA. In this lab, you're going to experiment with a subset of UCI's <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease'>Chronic Kidney Disease data set</a>, a collection of samples taken from patients in India over a two month period, some of whom were in the early stages of the disease. The starter code over at /Module4/assignment2.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by looking through the attribute information on the dataset website. Whenever you're given a dataset, the first thing you should do is find out as much about it as possible, both by reading up on any metadata, as well as by prodding through the actual data. Particularly, pay attention to what the docs say about these three variables: bgr, rc, and wc.\n",
    "2. Load up the kidney_disease.csv dataset from the /Module4/Datasets/ directory, and drop all rows that have any nans. You're probably already a pro at doing that by now. In addition to getting rid of nans, did you know that the .dropna() method (upon completion) also automatically re-checks your features and assigns them an appropriate inferred data types?\n",
    "3. Use an appropriate indexer command to select only the following columns: bgr, rc, and wc. Or alternatively, you can drop every other column, but it's probably easier to just use an indexer to select the one's you wish to keep.\n",
    "4. Do a check of your dataframe's dtypes. Anything that didn't make it to the right type, you may want to investigate. Look through the data and identify why the conversion failed. These types of problems often arise when you aren't in control of how your data is organized. Luckily the issue isn't too bad so once you've identified it, you can fix it through simple numeric coercion.\n",
    "5. Print the variance of your dataset, as well as a .describe() printout.\n",
    "6. Reduce your dataset to two principal components by run it through PCA, then check out the resulting visualization."
